## Introduction

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline. It covers each stage from data ingestion to processing and finally to storage, utilizing a robust tech stack that includes Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. Everything is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment and scalability.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/Philosh/Airflow-to-Kafka-to-PySpark-to-Cassandra/blob/main/Data%20engineering%20architecture.png)

The project is designed with the following components:

- **Data Source**: We use `randomuser.me` API to generate random user data for our pipeline.
- **Apache Airflow**: Responsible for orchestrating the pipeline and storing fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Apache Kafka and Zookeeper**: Used for streaming data from PostgreSQL to the processing engine.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Helps in monitoring and schema management of our Kafka streams.
- **Apache Spark**: For data processing with its master and worker nodes.
- **Cassandra**: Where the processed data will be stored.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Philosh/Airflow-to-Kafka-to-PySpark-to-Cassandra
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Airflow-to-Kafka-to-PySpark-to-Cassandra
    ```

3. Run Docker Compose to spin up the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

## Command to submit spark_stream job to spark master worker on docker container after uploading it
pip3 install cassandra-driver==3.29.0

spark-submit --packages com.datastax.spark:spark-cassandra-connector_2.12:3.4.1,org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.4.2 --master spark://<spark-master-worker-ip-address> spark_stream.py
